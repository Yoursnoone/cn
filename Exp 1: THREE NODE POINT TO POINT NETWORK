Exp 1: THREE NODE POINT TO POINT NETWORK
Aim: Simulate a three node point to point network with duplex links between them. Set queue size 
and vary the bandwidth and find number of packets dropped.
set ns [new Simulator] # Letter S is capital
set nf [open PA1.nam w] # open a nam trace file in write mode
$ns namtrace-all $nf # nf nam filename
set tf [open PA1.tr w] # tf trace filename
$ns trace-all $tf
proc finish { } {
global ns nf tf
$ns flush-trace# clears trace file contents
close $nf
close $tf

exit 0
}

AWK file: (Open a new editor using “vi command” and write awk file and save with “.awk”
extension)
#immediately after BEGIN should open braces {
BEGIN{ c=0;}
{
if($1= ="d")
{c++;
printf("%s\t%s\n",$5,$11);
}
}
END{ printf("The number of packets dropped =%d\n",c); }
Steps for execution
Open gedit editor and type program. Program name should have the extension “ .tcl ”
[root@localhost ~]# gedit lab1.tcl
Open gedit editor and type awk program. Program name should have the extension “.awk ”
[root@localhost ~]# gedit lab1.awk
Run the simulation program
[root@localhost~]# ns lab1.tcl
Here “ns” indicates network simulator. We get the topology shown in the snapshot.
Now press the play button in the simulation window and the simulation will begins.
After simulation is completed run awk file to see the output ,
[root@localhost~]# awk –f lab1.awk lab1.tr
To see the trace file contents open the file as ,
[root@localhost~]# gedit lab1.tr
Trace file contains 12 columns:
Event type, Event time, From Node, To Node, Packet Type, Packet Size, Flags (indicated by --------), 
Flow ID, Source address, Destination address, Sequence ID, Packet ID
