Exp 3: ETHERNET LAN USING N-NODES
Aim: Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes, change error rate and data rate and compare
throughput.

AWK file: (Open a new editor using “vi command” and write awk file and save with “.awk” 
extension)
BEGIN{
pkt=0;
time=0;
}
{
if($1= ="r" && $3= ="9" && $4= ="7"){
pkt = pkt + $6;
time =$2;
}
}
END {
printf("throughput:%fMbps",(( pkt / time) * (8 / 1000000)));
}
Steps for execution
Open gedit editor and type program. Program name should have the extension “ .tcl ”
[root@localhost ~]# gedit lab5.tcl
Open gedit editor and type awk program. Program name should have the extension “.awk ”
[root@localhost ~]# gedit lab5.awk
Run the simulation program
[root@localhost~]# ns lab5.tcl
o Here “ns” indicates network simulator. We get the topology shown in the snapshot.
o Now press the play button in the simulation window and the simulation will begins.
After simulation is completed run awk file to see the output ,
[root@localhost~]# awk –f lab5.awk lab5.tr
To see the trace file contents open the file as ,
[root@localhost~]# gedit lab5.tr
Here “h” indicates host.
